Now the next thing we need to do is to start writing code in Java. But before we can do that, you need to install java and set up your IDE.
So lets gets set and go with Java.
for the setup of development environment you need to follow some certain steps

we need [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html)

- **JDK(Java Development Kit)** is complete java package for developing java applications. It contains the following components
  - **JRE(Java Runtime Environment)** it basically create a **Java virtual machine(JVM)** for running java applications.
  - **Compiler**
  - **Java docs**
    Now download [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html), install it and after installing add its bin directory to environment path.
- **IDE**: is a software development environment for writing, debugging, and testing Java programs. we can write code very smoothly using IDE.
  there are many IDE's available for java. for example, **[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)**, [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/nb120/nb120.html), etc.

  After setting up JDK, install anyone of the of your favorite IDE just by clicking on the link and install it.
  It really Simple! If you're installing IntelliJ IDEA, download the _community edition_, it's totally free.
